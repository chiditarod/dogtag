      Good news!  Your team fundraising page has been successfully created and pre-populated with
      your team details on the Classy fundraising platform. While fundraising is not required to participate in CHIditarod, it's the
      epicness of our teams and their fundraising powers that give CHIditarod such a powerful impact
      fighting hunger in Chicago.  We hope you will join us on this quest!

      If you don't have a Classy account yet, you should see a
      "Claim Your Account" email from Classy in your inbox. Please open that email and follow the instructions
      to setup your Classy account, which will give you access to your fundraising page.
      If you were already a Classy user, simply go to
      %a{:href=>"http://classy.org"}
        http://classy.org
      and login.

            is listed on your profile page.
            This is your Classy Team fundraising profile. There are many ways to customize your team profile.
            You can (and probably should) invite your teammates to join your team
            and help fundraise with their own fundraising pages. All they need to do is visit your Team page and click "Join Team".
            Your team page will calculate how much your team has raised in total.  Complete with your fellow teams for
            Most Epic Fundraiser and show the world via the leaderboard!
