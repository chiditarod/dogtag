      Good news!  Your team fundraising page has been successfully created and pre-populated with
      your team details on the Classy fundraising platform. While fundraising is not required to participate in CHIditarod, it's the
      epicness of our teams and their fundraising powers that give CHIditarod such a powerful impact
      fighting hunger in Chicago.  We hope you will join us on this quest!
