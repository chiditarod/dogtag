Good news!

Your fundraising team has been successfully created and pre-populated with
your dogtag team details on the Classy fundraising platform. While fundraising is not
required to participate in CHIditarod, it's the epicness of our teams and their
fundraising powers that give CHIditarod such a powerful impact fighting hunger
in Chicago.  We hope you will join us on this quest!

If you don't have a Classy account yet, you should see a "Claim Your Account"
email from Classy in your inbox. Please open that email and follow the instructions
to setup your Classy account. If you were already a Classy user, simply go to http://classy.org and login.

Once you have logged in, you have 2 missions:


1. Create a Classy fundraising page.

This year we have an excellent set of PDF instructions to guide you in creating your
Classy fundraising page(s).  Check it out!

2. Customize your Classy fundraising team.

Your fundraising team is listed on your profile page. This is your Classy Team
fundraising profile. There are many ways to customize your team profile:

Team Fundraising Page: https://www.classy.org/team/<%= @team.classy_id %>?campaignId=<%= @team.race.classy_campaign_id %>
Customize: https://www.classy.org/team/<%= @team.classy_id %>/dashboard/overview

You can (and probably should) invite them to join your team and help fundraise with their own fundraising pages.
All they need to do is click the main page link and click Join Team. Your team page will calculate how much
your team has raised in total. Complete with your fellow teams for Most Epic Fundraiser and
show the world via the leaderboard!

Please try claiming your Classy account and rock that fundraiser! If you have issues, questions,
or concerns, we are here to help.. please email us at fundraising@chiditarod.org
