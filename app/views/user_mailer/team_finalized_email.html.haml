      How about some Fundraising?! Fundraising for The CHIditarod Foundation
      not only does good by giving out grants to other nonprofits in Chicago,
      but it also helps raise awareness of all that great work and effort your team
      is putting into the race! To setup your fundraising page, please go to
      %a{:href => "http://www.chiditarod.org/fundraising"}
        www.chiditarod.org/fundraising
      and follow the easy instructions to get started. There are some great
      %a{:href => "http://www.chiditarod.org/fundraising-incentives"}
        super bonus incentives
      for fundraising, too!
