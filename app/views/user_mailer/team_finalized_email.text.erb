How about some Fundraising?! Fundraising for The CHIditarod Foundation
not only does good by giving out grants to other nonprofits in Chicago,
but it also helps raise awareness of all that great work and effort your team
is putting into the race! To setup your fundraising page, please go to:

http://www.chiditarod.org/fundraising

Just follow the easy instructions to get started. There are some great
super bonus incentives for fundraising, too. See:

More communications will of course be on the way.
