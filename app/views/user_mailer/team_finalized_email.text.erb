How about some Fundraising?! Fundraising for The CHIditarod Foundation
not only does good by giving out grants to other nonprofits in Chicago,
but it also helps raise awareness of all that great work and effort your team
is putting into the race. As you read this, our dogtag robots are setting up
your first fundraising page.

Stay tuned for a confirmation email.  If you do not receive one, please visit:

http://www.chiditarod.org/fundraising

Just follow the easy instructions to get started. There are some great
super bonus incentives for fundraising, too. See:

More communications will of course be on the way.
