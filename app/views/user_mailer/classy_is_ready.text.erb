Good news! Your team fundraising page has been successfully created!

We are partnering with Classy.org this year to take advantage of their awesome fundraising platform.
If you are new to Classy.org, you should see a "Claim Your Account" email from Classy in your inbox.
Please open that email and follow the instructions to setup your Classy account. If you were
already a Classy user, simply go to http://classy.org and login.

http://classy.org

Once you have logged in, you should see 2 entries on your profile page:

1. Team: <%= @team.name %>

This is your Team fundraising profile. There are many ways to customize your team profile:

Main Page: https://www.classy.org/team/<%= @team.classy_id %>

You can (and probably should) invite them to join your team and help fundraise with their own fundraising pages.
All they need to do is click the main page link and click Join Team. Your team page will calculate how much
your team has raised in total. Complete with your fellow teams for Most Epic Fundraiser and
show the world via the leaderboard!

team fundraiser (#1, above). There are also many ways to customize your fundraiser page to tell your
story. It's easy! After customizing your page, it is very easy to share it!
